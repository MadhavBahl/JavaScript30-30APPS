# VANILLA JS
Is it a library? **NO**

Using "VanillaJS" means using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery.

People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries.

Here's a funny site that jokingly talks about this: <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a>

    // VanillaJS v1.0
    // Released into the Public Domain
    // Your code goes here:

As you can see, it's not really a framework or a library. It's just a running gag for framework-loving bosses or people who think you NEED to use a JS framework. It means you just use whatever your browser gives you.

**NO** FRAMEWORKS **NO** COMPILERS **NO** LIBRARIES **NO BOILERPLATE**
